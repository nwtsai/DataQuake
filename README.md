# DataQuake
A website that automatically formats, populates, and visualizes earthquake data using API calls.

# Description
‣ The purpose of DataQuake is to log pertinent information regarding all recent earthquakes within the past day, week, and month.

‣ A map is dynamically populated with red circles that indicate the location and magnitude of an earthquake.

‣ Information about each earthquake includes its location, magnitude, and timestamp.

‣ All data is updated in real time, and all information gathered is provided by the United States Geology Survey (USGS).

# Design
‣ Sifts through heaps of information by gathering data automatically via an API call to the USGS database

‣ Visualizes the data by integrating Google Maps with a dynamically drawn circle for every earthquake that happens around the globe

‣ Developed an algorithm that dynamically formats and styles the gathered data using javascript, regardless of the size of the data

‣ Utilized jQuery calls to modify HTML structures and classes when the user clicks on buttons in order to create an integrated user interface
