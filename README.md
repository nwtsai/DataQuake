# DataQuake
A website that automatically formats and populates earthquake data using API calls

# Description
‣ The purpose of DataQuake is to log pertinent information regarding all recent earthquakes within the past day, week, and month.

‣ Information about each earthquake includes its location, magnitude, and timestamp.

‣ All data is updated in real time, and all information gathered is provided by the United States Geology Survey (USGS).

‣ Knowing when and where earthquakes occur could be useful for planning your next vacation.

# Design
‣ Sifts through heaps of information by gathering data automatically via an API call to the USGS database

‣ Developed an algorithm that dynamically formats and styles the gathered data using javascript, regardless of the size of the data, using Handlebars.js

‣ Utilized jQuery calls to modify HTML structures and classes when the user clicks on buttons in order to create an integrated user interface

‣ Implemented an animated koala that climbs up and down a tree trunk by separating an image into components and animating individual shapes
